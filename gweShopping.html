Aerie makes it their mission to promote self-love, from selling a wide range of sizes, to partnering with the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA). Not only does Aerie feature curvy models, they also have ethnically diverse ones. Additionally, thanks to their new support in the fitting room program, customers can stick encouraging notes on the mirrors. You can use the #AerieReal hashtag to share untouched photos of yourself!</p2>
