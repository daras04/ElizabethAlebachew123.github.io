    <p>*Disclaimer: The purpose of this site is to educate and bring awareness to the impact of social media on body image. We want others to accept all body types, including influencer body types. However, we also want women and girls to be aware that there are many different body sizes and shapes that are all beautiful and that conforming to one body type is impossible. </p>
